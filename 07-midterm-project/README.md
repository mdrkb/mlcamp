# Midterm Project - Heart Failure Detection

## Motivation

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

That's why in this project, we will try several machine learning classification models to come up with a solution.

## Dataset

The dataset is collected from kaggel:

## Feature Description

- age: Person age.
- anaemia: Decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (boolean).
- creatinine_phosphokinase: Level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L).
- diabetes: If the patient has diabetes (boolean).
- ejection_fraction: Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage).
- high_blood_pressure: If the patient has hypertension (boolean).
- platelets: Platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL).
- serum_creatinine: Level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL).
- serum_sodium: Level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L).
- sex: Woman or man (binary).
- smoking: If the patient smokes or not (boolean).
- time: Follow-up period (days).
- DEATH_EVENT: If the patient deceased during the follow-up period (boolean).
